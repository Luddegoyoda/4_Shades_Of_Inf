 kawaii.1.d:0 "The kawaii competition is where the people of Kawaii decide on who is the most kawaii of them all. Winning this prestigious competition usually fast-tracks the person to office like Sakura did a few years ago. Now this competition is being held again and there are a few newcomers to the scene.\n\n The introduction of the E-girl to Kawaii has had a major impact on the way some perceive how our kawaii spirit should be used. Their way of loose and free thinking is completely heretical according to many traditionalists including Sakura. This competition could decide our future going forward."

 kawaii.11.d:0 "The shocking murder of a leading figure with her stature has been unheard of in Kawaii until today. Our loss can be felt everywhere across Kawaii. Sakura is gone and with her our way of life comes into question by all of her previous competitors.\n\nEver since she defeated the Reformists in the Kawaii Competition her authority had been growing and growing. Who is going to fill the vacuum left by her now?"
